# Contact book in Python. 


# Commands 

`/add_contact`: adds contact

`/remove_contact`: removes contact 

`/view`: prints your diary 

`/quit`: quits the program 

`/search`: Searches a certain contact and returns it. 


# Extras 

The file must be running in order to save all the data. If you quit the program fully, the
your contacts will be lost as the while loop ends.

In order to change the name, change the function argument of intro() to your name. The function call is located at the end of the `contact_book.py`.

The `/search` function uses linear search algorithm on average runtime of O(N)/2 and at worst case runtime of O(N).
